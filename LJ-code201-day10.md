# LJ Code 201 - Day 10 #

Ode to learning journal!

Took quiz 6 today. Big frowny face. If we went over that stuff in class I need to do something different in class.

It is a weekend. I m trying to get reset for the upcoming week. So we have a big test after this week. I will of course build it up to be harder than it is. One more Project too. Seems like we have come a long ways from the beginning but I m afraid if I take a break I will forget everything pretty fast.

Then it is on to the big project.  I am hoping to make it something I can carry forward after this class. We shall see.
