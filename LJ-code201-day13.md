 #LJ Code 201 - Day 13 #

 You guys have to read all of these. I hope I can provide some entertainment but these things have to be dreadfully boring at this point.

 I am so tired right now. If I had the energy I would go look up API and JQuery so I knew what people were talking about. 2 more days until the big test and then on to the project. I will jump on the 2 quizzes tomorrow. See you guys then.
