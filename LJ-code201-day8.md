#LJ Day 8

The last several days have been pretty intense. I have been forcing myself to struggle and ask for help less. It is hard with everyone doing it their own way. I am probably one of the worst about that though. I am trying to help other people but I am finding that that is probably not a good idea right now. I don't know enough to do it different ways and be able to look at someone else's code and see how to fix it.

I am really looking forward to group projects though.
