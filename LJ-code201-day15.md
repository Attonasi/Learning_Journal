# LJ day 15 #

Is it day 15 yet? I think we finished day 15 anyways.

Took the test. I really hate "what does this code do?" questions. Answer? RUN IT AND FIND OUT! kthnx.

I rely on linter and console errors to find bugs. I can't find them by just looking at the code. "Which one of these wont work?" Run them and find out ok? argle bargle.

I am writing up awesome pictures and implementation plans for the final project. ugh. See you on Monday.
