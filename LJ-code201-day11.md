#LJ day 11 201

Today's lecture had the most fundamentally important lesson about coding We will probably get out of this class. Breaking everything down into individual parts and adding and testing as you go is the most efficient way to code.

Then we promptly try to implement charts in lab and I do not know if it is possible to add a chart line by line. Will find out tomorrow.
