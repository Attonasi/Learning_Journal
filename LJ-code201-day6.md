# LJ Code 201 - Day 6

Weekend was awesome. 2 heaters went out. My wife had to deal with it which didn't mean the problem went away. Oh well.

The code I wrote worked. Questions and a thousand monkeys pounding on the keyboard. I still don't have a natural grasp of what goes in an object. I don't know why everything has to be in a function or a defined attribute. Maybe that is the answer...

Hopefully I get everything understood before we flush it all tomorrow but it sounds like we are flushing it all tomorrow.
